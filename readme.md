6. Difference between Statically typed and Dynamically typed programming language.

   Statically typed language is one that the type of a variable is known at compile time. For some languages this means that you as the programmer must specify what type each variable is.The main advantage here is that all kinds of checking can be done by the compiler, and therefore a lot of trivial bugs are caught at a very early stage.E.g C, C++, Java, Rust, Go, Scala.

   Dynamically tped language is a language that the  type is associated with run-time values, and not named variables/fields/etc. This means that you as a programmer can write a little quicker because you do not have to specify types every time (unless using a statically-typed language with type inference).Eg JavaScript, Perl, Ruby, Python, PHP, Erlang.
7. Data type 'undefined' indicates the absence of a value while 'null' indicates the absence of an object. 'null' is a keyword, but 'undefined is a normal identifier that happens to be a global property.
